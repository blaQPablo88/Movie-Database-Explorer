# Movie Database Explorer

## API: [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)

### Description: 
Create an application that allows users to search for movies, explore detailed information about each film, and create a personal watchlist. Users can search for movies by title, genre, or actor, view key details like ratings, cast, and reviews, and discover trending or recommended movies.

### Key Features:

- Search for movies by title, genre, or actor.
- Retrieve and display detailed information about each movie.
- Create a watchlist that saves movies of interest.


## Iterations:

### Iteration 1: Basic Movie Search

- Successfully connect to the API and fetch movie data.
- Allow users to search for movies by title and display basic details such as title and overview.
- Show movie posters(if possible) for the searched titles.

### Iteration 2: Detailed Movie Information

- Expand the application to fetch and display extended movie details, including cast, release date, and ratings.
- Create a structured format for displaying this information (e.g., in tables or something).
- Allow users to navigate back and forth between search results and detailed views.

### Iteration 3: Watchlist Functionality

- Implement a feature for users to create and manage a personal watchlist.
Enable users to add and remove movies from their watchlist.
- Save the watchlist data locally (e.g., in a file or something) so that it persists between sessions.
